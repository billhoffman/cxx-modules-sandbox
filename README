This Docker image contains the relevant code in order to compile C++ modules
using CMake and its Ninja generator.

GCC is installed into `/home/modules/misc/root/gcc` and CMake and `ninja` are
installed into `/home/modules/misc/root/cmake`. The image may be run using
`docker run -it $image` which will add these roots to `$PATH` automatically.

There is an example repository in `/home/modules/code/cxx-modules-sandbox/src`
which contains example code showing the viability of the tools. Note that there
are some restrictions:

  - GCC may not support all module features. Please see this page for
    information related to the current status:

      https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/cxx-modules

  - CMake does not support `import <header-unit>;` or `import "header-unit";`
    yet. There is example syntax for it in the example repository, but it is
    not valid CMake code (yet).
  - Installing and consuming external modules is not yet supported. This is
    related to header unit modules and they will likely end up with similar
    solutions (differing in details).

Merge requests and issues with the features not present in the base tools may
be sent to the following repositories:

  - CMake: https://gitlab.kitware.com/ben.boeckel/cmake/
  - Ninja: https://github.com/kitware/ninja/ (or email me at `Ben Boeckel
    <ben.boeckel@kitware.com>`)
  - This repository: https://gitlab.kitware.com/ben.boeckel/cxx-modules-sandbox
    * Contains the Dockerfile for creating this image as well as the example
      code cloned into the image.
